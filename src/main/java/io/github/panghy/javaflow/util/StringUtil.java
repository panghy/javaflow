/**
 * Utility class for UTF-8 and UTF-16 string operations and validation.
 *
 * <p>This class provides methods for handling string comparisons, size calculations,
 * and validation when dealing with UTF-8 encoded strings that are represented
 * internally as UTF-16 in Java. The main focus is on ensuring proper ordering
 * and size calculation for strings that will be serialized as UTF-8 bytes.
 *
 * <h2>UTF-8 vs UTF-16 Ordering</h2>
 * <p>Java stores strings using UTF-16 encoding internally, but when serialized
 * to bytes (as in {@link Tuple} encoding), strings are converted to UTF-8.
 * UTF-8 strings sort correctly based on Unicode code points when compared
 * using unsigned byte comparison, but UTF-16 strings do not always sort
 * the same way due to surrogate pair encoding.
 *
 * <h2>Surrogate Pair Handling</h2>
 * <p>Unicode code points above U+FFFF are encoded as surrogate pairs in UTF-16:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>High surrogates: U+D800 to U+DBFF (0x800 values)</li>
 *   <li>Low surrogates: U+DC00 to U+DFFF (0x400 values)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>To achieve UTF-8 ordering with UTF-16 strings, this class applies
 * adjustments to surrogate characters so they sort correctly relative
 * to non-surrogate characters.
 *
 * <h2>Usage Examples</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Compare strings as they would sort when UTF-8 encoded
 * int result = StringUtil.compareUtf8("hello", "world");
 *
 * // Calculate the size when string is encoded as UTF-8 bytes
 * int size = StringUtil.packedSize("cafÃ© ðŸ˜€");
 *
 * // Validate that a string is well-formed UTF-16
 * StringUtil.validate("valid string with emoji ðŸŽµ");
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>This class is derived from the FoundationDB project and maintains
 * compatibility with FoundationDB's string handling semantics.
 *

  // Compare two strings based on their UTF-8 code point values. Note that Java stores strings
