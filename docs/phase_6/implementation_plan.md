# JavaFlow Phase 6: Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for Phase 6's remote cancellation functionality. The implementation is designed to be minimal and build upon existing infrastructure while providing comprehensive cancellation capabilities.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 6.1: Core Cancellation Infrastructure (Week 1)

#### 6.1.1: FlowCancellationException Implementation

**Files to Create:**
- `src/main/java/io/github/panghy/javaflow/core/FlowCancellationException.java`

**Implementation Details:**
```java
package io.github.panghy.javaflow.core;

/**
 * Exception thrown when a Flow operation is cancelled.
 * This exception should generally not be caught by user code,
 * as it indicates the operation should be aborted immediately.
 */
public class FlowCancellationException extends RuntimeException {
    public FlowCancellationException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
    
    public FlowCancellationException(String message, Throwable cause) {
        super(message, cause);
    }
}
```

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for exception creation and inheritance
- Verify it's a RuntimeException (no forced catching)

#### 6.1.2: Enhanced Flow Utility Methods

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/main/java/io/github/panghy/javaflow/Flow.java`

**New Methods to Add:**
```java
/**
 * Checks if the current task has been cancelled.
 * @throws FlowCancellationException if the current task is cancelled
 */
public static void checkCancellation() {
    Task currentTask = FlowScheduler.CURRENT_TASK.get();
    if (currentTask != null && currentTask.isCancelled()) {
        throw new FlowCancellationException("Task was cancelled");
    }
}

/**
 * Returns true if the current task has been cancelled.
 */
public static boolean isCancelled() {
    Task currentTask = FlowScheduler.CURRENT_TASK.get();
    return currentTask != null && currentTask.isCancelled();
}
```

**Testing:**
- Test `checkCancellation()` throws when task is cancelled
- Test `isCancelled()` returns correct boolean value
- Test behavior when called outside flow context

#### 6.1.3: Enhanced await() Method

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/main/java/io/github/panghy/javaflow/Flow.java`

**Changes:**
```java
public static <T> T await(FlowFuture<T> future) throws Exception {
    if (futureReadyOrThrow(future)) {
        return future.getNow();
    }
    
    // Check for cancellation before awaiting
    checkCancellation();
    
    try {
        return scheduler.await(future);
    } catch (CancellationException e) {
        throw new FlowCancellationException("Future was cancelled", e);
    }
}
```

**Testing:**
- Verify `FlowCancellationException` is thrown instead of `CancellationException`
- Test cancellation detection before awaiting
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

### Phase 6.2: Enhanced Testing Infrastructure (Week 2)

#### 6.2.1: Local Cancellation Tests

**Files to Create:**
- `src/test/java/io/github/panghy/javaflow/core/FlowCancellationTest.java`

**Test Categories:**
1. Basic cancellation detection tests
2. Performance overhead tests
3. Edge case tests (cancellation after completion, etc.)
4. Integration with existing Task cancellation

#### 6.2.2: Remote Cancellation Tests

**Files to Create:**
- `src/test/java/io/github/panghy/javaflow/rpc/RemoteCancellationTest.java`

**Test Categories:**
1. End-to-end remote cancellation
2. Cancellation during network I/O
3. Network partition scenarios
4. Multiple concurrent cancellations

#### 6.2.3: Test Utilities

**Files to Create:**
- `src/test/java/io/github/panghy/javaflow/test/CancellationTestUtils.java`

**Utilities:**
- Helper methods for creating long-running test operations
- Mock services for testing remote cancellation
- Performance measurement utilities

### Phase 6.3: Documentation and Examples (Week 3)

#### 6.3.1: API Documentation Updates

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/main/java/io/github/panghy/javaflow/Flow.java` (Javadoc updates)
- `docs/design.md` (Add cancellation section)

**Documentation Topics:**
- When and how to use `Flow.checkCancellation()`
- Best practices for cancellation handling
- Performance considerations

#### 6.3.2: Example Code

**Files to Create:**
- `examples/cancellation/LongRunningOperationExample.java`
- `examples/cancellation/RemoteCancellationExample.java`

**Example Scenarios:**
- CPU-intensive operation with cancellation checks
- Remote service with cancellable operations
- Proper cleanup in cancellation handlers

### Phase 6.4: Integration and Validation (Week 4)

#### 6.4.1: Integration Testing

**Focus Areas:**
- Verify existing RPC cancellation still works
- Test interaction with simulation mode
- Validate performance impact is minimal

#### 6.4.2: Stress Testing

**Test Scenarios:**
- High-frequency cancellation operations
- Large numbers of concurrent cancellable operations
- Memory usage under cancellation load

#### 6.4.3: Backward Compatibility Validation

**Validation Points:**
- Existing code continues to work unchanged
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- Performance regression testing

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

1. **Exception Handling**: Use `FlowCancellationException` consistently
2. **Performance**: Minimize overhead of cancellation checks
3. **Thread Safety**: Ensure all cancellation operations are thread-safe
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive Javadoc for all new methods

### Testing Standards

1. **Coverage**: 100% line coverage for new cancellation code
2. **Edge Cases**: Test all boundary conditions and error scenarios
3. **Performance**: Verify cancellation overhead is < 1% in benchmarks
4. **Integration**: Test with real network conditions and failures

### Review Process

1. **Code Review**: All changes require peer review
2. **Design Review**: Architecture changes reviewed by team leads
3. **Performance Review**: Benchmark results reviewed before merge
4. **Documentation Review**: All docs reviewed for clarity and accuracy

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Performance Impact**: Mitigate with lightweight implementation and benchmarking
2. **Race Conditions**: Use existing Task synchronization mechanisms
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Extensive regression testing

### Schedule Risks

1. **Complexity Underestimation**: Buffer time built into each phase
2. **Integration Issues**: Early integration testing to catch issues
3. **Testing Bottlenecks**: Parallel development of tests and implementation

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
