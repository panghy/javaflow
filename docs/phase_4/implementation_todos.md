   - Implement integration with Flow.delay()

5. **Connection Pooling**
   - Implement connection pooling for endpoint reuse
   - Optimize connection management for efficiency

6. **Backpressure**
   - Implement backpressure mechanisms for stream control

14. **Monitoring**
    - Add monitoring and metrics collection for RPC operations
    - Track performance, errors, and throughput

## Low Priority Tasks

1. **Message Batching**
   - Implement message batching for small messages
   - Optimize network usage for many small messages

2. **Protocol Versioning**
   - Create protocol versioning support for backward compatibility

## Implementation Schedule

The implementation will proceed in phases, focusing first on the core functionality and then expanding to additional features:

1. **Phase 4.1 (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Core interfaces and message format
   - Basic serialization
   - Promise tracking and resolution

2. **Phase 4.2 (Weeks 3-4)**
   - Stream support
   - Error handling
   - Simulation integration

3. **Phase 4.3 (Weeks 5-6)**
   - Connection management
   - Endpoint registry
   - Testing framework

4. **Phase 4.4 (Weeks 7-8)**
   - Security features
   - Performance optimization
   - Example applications

This schedule aligns with the overall Phase 4 timeline described in the design.md document.
