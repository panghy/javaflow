## Core Implementation Overview

### Design Philosophy
The RPC framework follows JavaFlow's actor model philosophy, with a focus on location transparency and deterministic behavior. Key design aspects include:

1. **Promise-Based Communication**: The ability to pass promises and futures across the network
2. **Stream Support**: Native support for bidirectional streaming
3. **Serialization Agnosticism**: Allowing users to supply their own serialization mechanism
4. **Simulation Compatibility**: The same RPC code works in both real and simulation modes
5. **Endpoint Resolution**: Flexible mapping between logical services and physical locations
6. **Test-driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability and correctness

### Architecture
The RPC system is built on several key components:

1. **FlowRpcTransport**: The main entry point for RPC operations, providing registration and endpoint access
2. **FlowRpcTransportImpl**: Complete implementation with message handling, connection management, and error recovery
3. **EndpointResolver**: Maps logical service IDs to physical network locations with load balancing
4. **RemotePromiseTracker**: Tracks promises that cross network boundaries
5. **StreamManager**: Manages streams that cross network boundaries
6. **Message Format**: Structured format for all RPC communications
7. **Serialization Framework**: Unified system for converting objects to/from wire format with generic type preservation
8. **ConnectionManager**: Complete connection establishment, monitoring, and re-establishment with endpoint resolver integration
9. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy for handling RPC-specific errors

## Recent Major Implementations

1. **Complete RPC Transport Implementation**: Fully implemented the FlowRpcTransportImpl class with:
   - Comprehensive message handling for all RPC message types (REQUEST, RESPONSE, ERROR, PROMISE_COMPLETE, STREAM_DATA, STREAM_CLOSE)

   - Proper handling of both incoming and outgoing connections
   - Support for both promise-based and stream-based RPC calls
   - Integration with the serialization framework for type-safe communication
   - Extensive debugging and logging capabilities for troubleshooting

2. **Serialization System Refactoring**: Streamlined the serialization architecture by:
   - Removing redundant system type serializers (PromiseSerializer, PromiseStreamSerializer, SystemTypeSerializerFactory)
   - Integrating system type handling directly into the RPC transport layer
   - Preserving generic type information across network boundaries through TypeToken and TypeDescription
   - Simplifying the serialization pipeline while maintaining full functionality

3. **Enhanced Connection Management**: Improved the ConnectionManager with:
   - Full integration with the EndpointResolver for dynamic service discovery
   - Support for both EndpointId-based and direct Endpoint-based connections

   - Connection monitoring and cleanup when connections fail

4. **Promise Stream Improvements**: Enhanced PromiseStream functionality with:
   - Added onClose() method for monitoring stream lifecycle
   - Improved close handling and proper completion of close futures

   - Proper cancellation and cleanup when timeouts occur

7. **Endpoint Model Simplification**: Refactored from three-tier to two-tier architecture:
   - Simplified endpoint resolution with direct EndpointId to Endpoint mapping
   - Improved round-robin load balancing for multiple physical endpoints
   - Better separation between local and remote endpoint handling

## Next Steps

The core RPC framework is now complete and fully functional. Future enhancements will focus on:

1. Advanced performance optimizations (message batching, improved backpressure)
2. Enhanced fault injection and chaos testing capabilities
3. Support for multi-format serialization (protobuf, JSON, etc.)
4. Protocol versioning support for backward compatibility
5. Security features (TLS, authentication, authorization)
6. Monitoring and metrics collection
7. Convenience helper methods for common RPC patterns

With the completion of Phase 4, the framework is ready for building production distributed systems using the actor model.
