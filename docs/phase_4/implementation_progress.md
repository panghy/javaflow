- ‚è≥ Zero-copy buffer handling for large payloads

### Performance and Monitoring
- ‚è≥ Message batching capabilities for small messages
- ‚è≥ Monitoring and metrics collection for RPC operations

### Security

- ‚è≥ Authorization framework for access control on RPC endpoints

### Versioning and Compatibility
- ‚è≥ Protocol versioning support for backward compatibility
- ‚è≥ Migration tools for protocol version changes

## Core Implementation Overview

### Design Philosophy
The RPC framework follows JavaFlow's actor model philosophy, with a focus on location transparency and deterministic behavior. Key design aspects include:

1. **Promise-Based Communication**: The ability to pass promises and futures across the network
2. **Stream Support**: Native support for bidirectional streaming
3. **Serialization Agnosticism**: Allowing users to supply their own serialization mechanism
4. **Simulation Compatibility**: The same RPC code works in both real and simulation modes
5. **Test-driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability and correctness

### Architecture
The RPC system is built on several key components:

1. **FlowRpcTransport**: The main entry point for RPC operations, providing registration and endpoint access
2. **RemotePromiseTracker**: Tracks promises that cross network boundaries
3. **StreamManager**: Manages streams that cross network boundaries
4. **Message Format**: Structured format for all RPC communications
5. **Serialization Framework**: Pluggable system for converting objects to/from wire format
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy for handling RPC-specific errors

## Next Steps

1. Complete the special serialization handlers for system types
2. Implement connection management with re-establishment
3. Add connection pooling and backpressure mechanisms
4. Expand the test suite with more complex scenarios and edge cases
5. Enhance fault injection for more thorough RPC testing
6. Complete the RPC method handler implementation in SimulatedFlowRpcTransport

Once these are complete, we'll move on to the remaining features with a focus on security, performance optimizations, and protocol versioning.

## Conclusion

The JavaFlow RPC Framework implementation is progressing well, with the core functionality now in place. The most critical components have been implemented, providing a solid foundation for the remaining features.

The implementation follows the design outlined in the docs/phase_4/design.md and docs/phase_4/rpc_design.md documents, with a focus on maintaining the key properties of location transparency, promise-based communication, and simulation compatibility.

Recent improvements have significantly enhanced the test coverage of the RPC framework, particularly for the SimulatedFlowRpcTransport component. This has ensured that the code meets the project's coverage requirements (85% line coverage and 75% branch coverage), making the system more reliable and easier to maintain.

With the current progress, it's already possible to build distributed systems using the RPC framework, with support for different communication patterns (request-response, one-way, and streaming) and comprehensive error handling. The test infrastructure ensures that these features work correctly and will continue to do so as development progresses.
