# JavaFlow

> A Java-based actor concurrency framework designed to support highly concurrent, asynchronous programming with deterministic execution for testing.

JavaFlow reimagines the core ideas of [FoundationDB's Flow](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/tree/main/flow) actor framework in idiomatic Java, leveraging JDK Continuations and structured concurrency instead of any custom compiler or preprocessor.

## Overview

JavaFlow allows you to write asynchronous code in a linear, sequential style through the use of futures and actors, while maintaining deterministic execution for testing purposes. The framework is specifically designed to combine the simplicity of writing sequential code with the performance benefits of event-driven systems.

### Key Features

- **Actor Model & Futures**: Lightweight actors (implemented using JDK Continuations) communicate via futures and promises for asynchronous operations
- **Cooperative Scheduling**: Single-threaded event loop that schedules actors in a cooperative manner
- **Prioritized Execution**: Task prioritization to ensure time-critical actors run before lower-priority work
- **Non-blocking I/O**: All I/O is integrated via asynchronous operations that yield futures
- **Deterministic Simulation**: Run the entire system in a controlled scheduler and clock for reproducible testing
- **Error Handling & Cancellation**: Integrated exception handling and automatic cancellation for unwanted operations
- **Idiomatic Java**: Pure Java implementation using JDK 21 features with minimal external dependencies

## Project Status

Phase 4 will focus on building the asynchronous I/O infrastructure, allowing network and disk operations to seamlessly integrate with the existing actor model. Following the Flow framework's design principles, all I/O operations will be non-blocking and will return futures that can be awaited by actors. The I/O system will be designed to support both real-world and simulated modes, paving the way for the deterministic simulation environment in Phase 5.

## Requirements

- JDK 21 or later
- Gradle 8.14 or compatible version
- Requires JDK with Continuations support (uses internal JDK classes for continuation-based scheduling)

## Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Run a specific test
./gradlew test --tests "fully.qualified.TestClassName"

# Run checkstyle validation
./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest

# Clean build
./gradlew clean build

# Generate JaCoCo test coverage report
./gradlew jacocoTestReport

# Verify test coverage meets thresholds
./gradlew jacocoTestCoverageVerification
```

### Code Style and Quality

The project uses Checkstyle to enforce Java coding standards based on the Google Java Style Guide:

- Indentation: 2 spaces (no tabs)
- Max line length: 100 characters
- One statement per line
- No wildcard imports
- Proper bracing (always use braces with if/for/while)
- Consistent naming conventions

Checkstyle validation is automatically part of the build process. To see detailed checkstyle reports, check the build/reports/checkstyle directory after running the build.

### Test Coverage Requirements

JaCoCo is used to enforce code coverage requirements:

- Line Coverage: Minimum 85%
- Branch Coverage: Minimum 75% 

Coverage reports are generated in the build/reports/jacoco directory after running the build.

## Features and Components

JavaFlow provides:

### Core Components
- **FlowFuture & FlowPromise**: For managing asynchronous operations
- **SingleThreadedScheduler**: Cooperative multitasking with one task active at a time
- **Task & TaskPriority**: Prioritized operations for optimal scheduling
- **Flow API**: Simple entry point for creating and scheduling asynchronous tasks
- **Pump Method**: Deterministic task processing for testing and simulation
- **FlowClock & Timers**: Time-based operations and controllable clock for testing
- **I/O Interfaces** (coming in Phase 4): Non-blocking network and file operations
- **FlowTransport** (coming in Phase 4): Message-passing layer for distributed communication

### Design Principles
1. A programming model where asynchronous code is written in a sequential style
2. A single-threaded event loop for deterministic scheduling of actors
3. High concurrency through cooperative multitasking rather than preemptive threading
4. Deterministic simulation for testing distributed system behaviors
5. Automatic cancellation of unwanted operations and proper error propagation
6. Comprehensive logging and debugging tools for asynchronous actors

### Example Usage
```java
// Using static imports for cleaner code
import static io.github.panghy.javaflow.Flow.*;

// Create a simple actor using Flow
FlowFuture<String> result = startActor(() -> {
    // Do some work
    String partialResult = doSomeWork();

    // Yield to let other tasks run
    await(yieldF());

    // Continue processing after yielding
    return finalizeWork(partialResult);
});

// Use the result when it's ready
result.whenComplete((value, error) -> {
    if (error == null) {
        System.out.println(value);
    }
});

// Using timer functionality
FlowFuture<Void> delayedOperation = startActor(() -> {
    // Do initial work
    initialSetup();

    // Wait for 5 seconds
    await(delay(5.0));

    // Perform operation after delay
    return finalOperation();
});

// Using asynchronous I/O (coming in Phase 4)
FlowFuture<ByteBuffer> fileReadOperation = startActor(() -> {
    // Open a file asynchronously
    FlowAsyncFile file = await(openFile("/path/to/file"));

    // Read data asynchronously
    ByteBuffer data = await(file.read(0, 1024));

    // Close the file
    await(file.close());

    return data;
});
```

### Asynchronous I/O Integration (Phase 4)

In Phase 4, JavaFlow will implement non-blocking I/O operations that integrate seamlessly with the actor model. Key aspects of this phase include:

1. **Java NIO Integration**: Leveraging Java's non-blocking I/O capabilities (java.nio) while ensuring all operations are properly managed by the Flow scheduler
2. **Unified I/O Abstraction**: Providing a consistent API for all I/O operations that return futures which can be awaited by actors
3. **Event Loop Integration**: Ensuring I/O events are processed by the single-threaded event loop in a deterministic manner
4. **Location Transparency**: Using the same API for local and remote communication, enabling seamless transition to simulation mode
5. **RPC Framework**: Building a robust, promise-based remote procedure call mechanism for actor communication across network boundaries

I/O operations in JavaFlow will never block the main thread. When an actor awaits an I/O operation, it will yield control to other actors until the operation completes. This design ensures maximum concurrency while maintaining the deterministic, single-threaded execution model that makes Flow-based systems both highly performant and easily testable.
