# JavaFlow

> A Java-based actor concurrency framework designed to support highly concurrent, asynchronous programming with deterministic execution for testing.

JavaFlow reimagines the core ideas of [FoundationDB's Flow](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/tree/main/flow) actor framework in idiomatic Java, leveraging JDK virtual threads and structured concurrency instead of any custom compiler or preprocessor.

## Overview

JavaFlow allows you to write asynchronous code in a linear, sequential style through the use of futures and actors, while maintaining deterministic execution for testing purposes. The framework is specifically designed to combine the simplicity of writing sequential code with the performance benefits of event-driven systems.

### Key Features

- **Actor Model & Futures**: Lightweight actors (implemented as virtual threads) communicate via futures and promises for asynchronous operations
- **Cooperative Scheduling**: Single-threaded event loop that schedules actors in a cooperative manner
- **Prioritized Execution**: Task prioritization to ensure time-critical actors run before lower-priority work
- **Non-blocking I/O**: All I/O is integrated via asynchronous operations that yield futures
- **Deterministic Simulation**: Run the entire system in a controlled scheduler and clock for reproducible testing
- **Error Handling & Cancellation**: Integrated exception handling and automatic cancellation for unwanted operations
- **Idiomatic Java**: Pure Java implementation using JDK 25 features with minimal external dependencies

## Project Status

JavaFlow is in the early stages of development. Below are the major development phases and our current status:

## Requirements

- JDK 24 (updated from earlier versions)
- Gradle 8.14 or compatible version
- Support for virtual threads (introduced in JDK 21 and improved in JDK 24)
- Note: We plan to leverage more advanced features as they become available in JDK 25+

## Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Run a specific test
./gradlew test --tests "fully.qualified.TestClassName"

# Run checkstyle validation
./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest

# Clean build
./gradlew clean build

# Generate JaCoCo test coverage report
./gradlew jacocoTestReport

# Verify test coverage meets thresholds
./gradlew jacocoTestCoverageVerification
```

### Code Style and Quality

The project uses Checkstyle to enforce Java coding standards based on the Google Java Style Guide:

- Indentation: 2 spaces (no tabs)
- Max line length: 100 characters
- One statement per line
- No wildcard imports
- Proper bracing (always use braces with if/for/while)
- Consistent naming conventions

Checkstyle validation is automatically part of the build process. To see detailed checkstyle reports, check the build/reports/checkstyle directory after running the build.

### Test Coverage Requirements

JaCoCo is used to enforce code coverage requirements:

- Line Coverage: Minimum 85%
- Branch Coverage: Minimum 75% 

Coverage reports are generated in the build/reports/jacoco directory after running the build.

## Features and Components

JavaFlow provides:

### Core Components
- **FlowFuture & FlowPromise**: For managing asynchronous operations
- **SingleThreadedScheduler**: Cooperative multitasking with one task active at a time
- **Task & TaskPriority**: Prioritized operations for optimal scheduling
- **Flow API**: Simple entry point for creating and scheduling asynchronous tasks

### Design Principles
1. A programming model where asynchronous code is written in a sequential style
2. A single-threaded event loop for deterministic scheduling of actors
3. High concurrency through cooperative multitasking rather than preemptive threading
4. Deterministic simulation for testing distributed system behaviors
5. Automatic cancellation of unwanted operations and proper error propagation
6. Comprehensive logging and debugging tools for asynchronous actors

### Example Usage
```java
// Create a simple actor using Flow
FlowFuture<String> result = Flow.start(() -> {
    // Do some work
    String partialResult = doSomeWork();
    
    // Yield to let other tasks run
    Flow.yield().await();
    
    // Continue processing after yielding
    return finalizeWork(partialResult);
});

// Use the result when it's ready
result.thenAccept(System.out::println);
```
